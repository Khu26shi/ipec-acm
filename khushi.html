<h1><u>Technical painting</u></h1>
<p>Technical art history is an interdisciplinary field of 
    <strong>study at the cross-section of science and humanities in 
    which an increasingly wide range of analytical tools is 
    employed to shed light on the creative process from idea 
    to artwork.</strong> Researchers from varying fields among which 
    art history, conservation, and conservation science 
    collaborate in an<em> manner to gain 
    “a thorough understanding</em> of the physical object in terms 
    of original intention, <br>choice of materials and techniques 
    as well as the context in and for which the work was created, 
    its meaning and contemporary perception.”

        <p>Two main pathways are followed to explore the physical 
            reality of a work of art: an experimental approach, and 
            the research of documentary sources.
             The experimental&nbsp;&nbsp; approach includes the direct 
             analysis of works of art and artisanal materials by 
             technical means. Documentary sources include books of 
             secrets and other contemporary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; writings that deal with artists’ 
             techniques and materials. These sources are vital to the 
             interpretation of the experimental data 
             It is the combination of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these two pathways that calls for 
             the broad range of methodologies and interdisciplinarity of 
             research in the field of technical art history.&lt;p&gt;</p>

                 In the early twentieth century the first laboratories focusing on applying scientific 
                 techniques on artworks were established around the world. 
                 In 1888, the Rathgen-Forschungslabor was founded in Berlin as 
                 the first museum laboratory in the world, and in 1928, Edward 
                 Forbes established the first conservation research centre in the 
                 United States at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University 
                 The establishment of these and other similar institutes was 
                 imperative to the development of a new approach of studying 
                 materials and techniques, and to the shift of conservation from 
                 a craft to a science-based practice.
